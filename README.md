# Optimization algorithms

Includes a suite of mathematical optimization algoriths for a UCSD course. It includes the following algorithms compared on an MNIST classificator:

- Gradient descent
- Backtracking line search
- Adaptive gradient descent
- Nesterov accelerated gradient descent
- Newton
- Conjugate gradient Fletcher Reeves
- Conjugate gradient Polak Ribiere

Each algorithm has been tested with many parameters. For some algorithm, a grid search has been executed to find the best parameters. Each algorithm includes plots and performance information.
